# hangman
Simple Hangman Game Code in C++
This code generates a random word from a list of words, and then prompts the player to guess letters in the word. If the player makes too many incorrect guesses, the game is over and the player loses. If the player guesses all the letters in the word before reaching the maximum number of incorrect guesses, they win.
